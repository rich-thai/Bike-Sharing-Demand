# Bike-Sharing-Demand
This is based on a competition from Kaggle (data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview)
I predict the hourly demand for the bike sharing service using a Random Forest Regression model and evaluate the result based on the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
